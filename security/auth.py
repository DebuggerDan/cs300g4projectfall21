'''
planning for functions n stuff here.

int loginGrabber()
{
    some kind of function which takes login info, passes it to some sanitizing function in sec, then if that's ok check
    the database for correct credentials. Maybe have the passing to database be done in another function?
}

int loginDatabaseControl()
{
    takes the login info from loginGrabber() and does some database stuff to check if it's ok
    returns value if login info was found
}
